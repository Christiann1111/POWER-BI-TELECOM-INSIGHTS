# 📊 AtliQo 5G Impact Analysis 

## 📋 Project Overview

AtliQo, one of the leading telecom providers in India, launched its 5G plans in May 2022. However, following the launch, the management noticed a decline in active users and revenue growth. To understand this issue, AtliQo’s business director requested an analytical comparison of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) for the periods before and after the 5G launch.

The primary goals of this analysis are to:
- Compare KPIs between the pre- and post-5G launch periods
- Provide actionable insights to help recover active user rates and improve key metrics
- Explore optimization opportunities for AtliQo's internet plans to attract more active users
